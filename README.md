# top-pot-donut-provision
Simulates Top Pot's donut demand in Seattle locations

The goal of this program is to efficiently simulate how many donuts several different Top Pot's Donut stores will need for each hour they are open every day.

This was done utilizing a constructor function, and then using a for loop to loop through and produce a simulation for each hour of the day whenever the run method is called.

My one source was http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1527803/generating-random-numbers-in-javascript-in-a-specific-range, which is where I got the getRandomArbitrary function.
